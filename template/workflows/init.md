description: Initialize the current repository for superpowers-extended by declaring repo-specific configuration in its instruction files

# /init Workflow (superpowers-extended)

superpowers-extended skills, commands, and agents reference repo-specific values through `<KEY>` placeholders (for example `<PLAN_PATH_PATTERN>`, `<BASELINE_VERIFICATION_COMMAND>`). This workflow declares the actual values inside the target repository's own instruction files, where every pack file resolves them at runtime. Pack files themselves are never edited: plugin installations are read-only, and checked-in copies stay diff-clean against the pack.

## Deliverable Saves

The only deliverable of this workflow is the `Superpowers Extended Configuration` section written into the repository's instruction files. Commit it with the repository's normal instruction-file conventions.

## Workflow File Edits

Do not edit workflow files unless the user's current request explicitly asks to change a workflow file or workflow behavior. A workflow path alone can select the workflow context; it is not permission to edit that file.

## Execution Steps

1. Inventory
Inspect the repository to ground a proposal for every key below: build and test tooling (`package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, CI workflow files), docs layout, and existing `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` content.
If a `Superpowers Extended Configuration` section already exists in an instruction file, load it and treat this run as an update of that section.

2. Propose Values
Present one proposed value per key with the evidence it was inferred from (file or command).
Ask the user only about keys that cannot be inferred confidently. Never invent verification or test commands; propose only commands proven to exist in the repository.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `REPO_INSTRUCTION_FILES` | The repo's instruction files, such as `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent |
| `DESIGN_DOC_PATH_PATTERN` | Where brainstorming design docs are written (e.g. `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md`) |
| `PLAN_PATH_PATTERN` | Where implementation plans are written (e.g. `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md`) |
| `PLAN_DIRECTORY` | Directory to search first when only a plan filename is given |
| `BASELINE_VERIFICATION_COMMAND` | Default repo-wide verification command (e.g. `make check`, `npm test`) |
| `SUPPLEMENTAL_VERIFICATION_COMMANDS` | Extra commands triggered by changed surfaces (CLI, deploy, build, generation); may be `none` |
| `TEST_FRAMEWORK_AND_COMMANDS` | The repo's test stack and command conventions |
| `TEST_FILE_LOCATIONS` | Where tests and shared test helpers belong |
| `TARGETED_TEST_COMMAND` | Narrow test command for the touched scope |
| `FULL_TEST_SUITE_COMMAND` | Broader test suite command |

If the repository has no test suite or verification tooling yet, record the honest value `none yet` rather than a fabricated command; skills treat that as "report the gap" rather than "run something".

3. Write Configuration
After the user approves the values, upsert the following section into `CLAUDE.md` at the repository root (create the file if it does not exist). If `AGENTS.md` exists, mirror the identical section there. Preserve all other content of both files; only add or replace this one section.

```markdown
## Superpowers Extended Configuration

superpowers-extended skills, commands, and agents resolve `<KEY>` placeholders from this section.

- `REPO_INSTRUCTION_FILES`: <value>
- `DESIGN_DOC_PATH_PATTERN`: <value>
- `PLAN_PATH_PATTERN`: <value>
- `PLAN_DIRECTORY`: <value>
- `BASELINE_VERIFICATION_COMMAND`: <value>
- `SUPPLEMENTAL_VERIFICATION_COMMANDS`: <value>
- `TEST_FRAMEWORK_AND_COMMANDS`: <value>
- `TEST_FILE_LOCATIONS`: <value>
- `TARGETED_TEST_COMMAND`: <value>
- `FULL_TEST_SUITE_COMMAND`: <value>
```

4. Validate
Re-read the written file(s) and confirm: the section exists, every key has a value, and no value is still an angle-bracket placeholder.

5. Report
List the file(s) written and the final key values. Note that `/plan`, `/execute`, `/execute_parallel`, `/full_cycle`, `/quick`, and the pack's skills and agents now resolve their placeholders from this section.

## Execution Requirements

- Never modify files that belong to the pack itself (the plugin installation directory, or checked-in copies under `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.agents/`, `workflows/`).
- Block and require user confirmation before writing the configuration section. Do not write unconfirmed guesses.
- Preserve every byte of pre-existing instruction-file content outside the upserted section.
